On this assignment, I have completed all of the requirements:
1)I was able to make the bullet appear and shoot from my player.
2)I added some code to make the bullets hit the enemies. 
3)I tried doing the extra credit, but my attempt was not successful.
4)I was even able to add two more bullets to the scenario and made my player shoot a tryshot(shoot three bullet at one time instead of one).
    4a)The idea came to my head, and I was just very interested to add it to the game.
